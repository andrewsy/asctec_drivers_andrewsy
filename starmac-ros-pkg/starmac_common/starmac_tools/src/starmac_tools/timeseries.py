  In general time series data t, x will have non-uniform sampling interval and further

  This function takes a tuple of tuples as input. Each of the inner tuples must contain as its
  first element a 'kind' argument (per the kind argument of scipy.interpolate.interp1d; you
  probably want to use either 'linear' or 'zero'). The second element of the tuple is a numpy array
  of input sample times, and as its remaining elements, 1-D arrays of the
  data to be resampled.
  
  The second argument, dt, is the desired output sample period.
  
  The output will first a vector of the new sample times, and second, a tuple of tuples, 
  the outer tuple of which is the same length as the input one.
