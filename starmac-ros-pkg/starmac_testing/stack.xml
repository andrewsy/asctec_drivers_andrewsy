  <description brief="starmac_testing">
  Stack for testing launch files, etc. May have onerous dependencies but that's
  okay, the idea is to have the tests and their dependencies here rather than putting
  tests in individual stacks and potentially adding extraneous dependencies to those
  stacks just so their tests will work. E.g. when testing vicon, might also want
  to run estimator, but in general vicon_mocap shouldn't depend on flyer_est.
